# pewpewhub (now the non-GPT version, lmao)

For-the-lolz side project.

PewPewHub is an API to help track world conflicts and geolocate events. Mostly targeted towards military and/or geopolitical conflicts.

All location data is defined using standard GeoJson models so building UIs to consume this API should be quite straightforward.

If you want to reimplement this on any other language, etc, just follow the classes defined at PPH.PublicContracts.

Will I get this anywhere close to a decent state? Who knows.
